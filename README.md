# Raw-material-Spices-Price-Forecasting.
## Business Problem: 
The business problem at hand is the unpredictable fluctuation in the prices of raw spice materials, negatively impacting the cost structure and inventory management.
## Business Solution: 
First, I collected research papers related to our problem and after that I tried to obtain any relevant dataset from the collected research articles. Using a secondary dataset (provided by our client) I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using MySQL and Python for deriving preliminary insights from the data. After EDA, I jumped into the Data Preprocessing section and cleaned the raw data accordingly using MySQL and Python. Then, I pushed the cleaned data from MySQL to Power BI for visualizing the data. I also used MS Excel as well as an open-source online platform called Looker Studio for creating interactive dashboards.
## Technology stack:
### 1. For EDA and Data Preprocessing:
• Python: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
• MySQL
### 2. For Data Visualization:
• Power Bi.
• Looker Studio.
• MS Excel.
## Business Benefits:
• Optimize procurement strategies and reduce production costs by 10%.
• Achieve cost savings in raw material procurement and inventory management at least by 20%.
